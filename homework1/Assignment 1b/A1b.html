	<h2>Where This Stands</h2>
	<p id = "headerImage">		
	It's pretty obvious based on this submission that I fall firmly into
	the "beginner" category of HTML programming.  However, this result
	should not be taken at face value; it is an unfortunate outcome of an
	overloaded schedule during the available time frame to complete the assignment.</p>
	<p>That being said and despite what this page looks like, I do feel like I have a comfortable basic understanding of
	what CSS is designed to accomplish and how it makes both consistency and changes
	in design easier to implement.  I just need to spend more time working with it hands-on.</p>
	
	<h2>Moving Forward</h2>
	<p>This is not reflective of my typical approach to an assignment.  When I run into
	issues as evidenced, I typically have heavy correspondence with the professor.
	That was just not possible for this assignment in the window of opportunity that I had to work on it.  
	But it will be the approach moving forward.  I will have the proper time to tackle future assignments.</p>
	
	<h2>Speaking of E-mails...</h2>
	<p>The one message that I did send was likely the most "facepalm"-worthy of any you received for the assignment.  (Yea, the one about whether content was to be created for 1a? 'Twas me.)  Let me apologize now for the time that was wasted in acknowledging it.  I managed to supremely misinterpret the wording in the assignment; I've no idea how, as it seems pretty clear now.
	<p><i>***Don't consider any of the above to be a plea, cry for pity, or any of the like.
	It's meant to be an honest &amp; candid evaluation of this submission and where it went wrong.</i></p>
